This is a Pokemon imspired application that I helped create with my group in ICS 212 in Spring 2020. This project helped me learn how to create and implement GUIs. 

For this project, we created a program that allows the user to search for and catch pokemon. We also had a feature that lets you look at the stats of the pokemon that you come across through the pokedex and look at the ones you've already caught through your backpack.
