summary: A website designed to help UH Manoa students sell items.
---

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide students at UH Manoa with a website that allows them to buy and sell goods easily within the community. Many goods that students purchase when going to college have high turnover rates. The problem with these are that they are usually difficult to sell quickly as usually only other students are willing to buy them. When buying or selling such items through a global platform such as Ebay or Facebook, students have to worry about shipping costs, delivery time, and scams. The use of a local application can reduce or eliminate many of these concerns.

## Website details
**You must log in to see the following pages.**

## Developer notes
Personally, I created the user profile(along with the items displayed on the user profile), implemented the bidding function, and worked on developing a more intuitive registration system. Although, the registration system still needs configuration to be properly implemented.
I learned many things from working on this project. I have worked on other group projects before but none have been this big or in depth. I learned about itegrating databases and user accounts. I also learned about the deployment of websites and how they work. I also learned how to better manage group projects by utilizing the issue function on GitHub to divide work more easily which greatly helped move development progress along. Overall, this was a very challenging project. I couldn't accomplish everything I wanted to, but with trying I learned a lot more about the way functional programming works and overall gained a better understanding of software development. I plan on continuing to develop this website to get it to the final I envisioned for it.
