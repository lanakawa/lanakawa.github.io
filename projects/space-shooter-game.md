This is a simple game that I created with my group in ICS 111. It is very similar to the game Galaga where you pilot a ship and shoot missiles at incoming enemy ships. In Galaga, the enemy ships spawn from the top of the screen and go down towards the player at the bottom. In our version, enemy ships spawn from all sides so you must be weary of hugging the edges fo the screen. We also implimented multidirectional movement so the ship is not confined to the four directionals(forward, back, left, right)
