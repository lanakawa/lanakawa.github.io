## Tires and computer science? 
Think of the convenience of having a specialized set of tires to solve the problems that come with the type of environment they’re being used in. Snow tires for snowy climates, off roading tires for dirt or sandy conditions, or standard tires for normal conditions. Now, imagine a specialized computer science pattern that can solve the common problems that occur in computer science. They’re not solutions that can just be copy and pasted into the problem to be solved, but a template that can be used to assists in the solving of the problem. There are specific design patterns that can be applied to specific problems that need to be solved. For example, some commonly used design patterns are, a singleton design pattern, a pattern whose only objective is to create one instance of a class and to provide a global access point to that object. Although the use isn’t very good unless used in a situation where it is absolutely needed, because the use of global variables is generally a bad practice because of its inefficiency.  This is similar to how snow tires are only really useful while driving though snowy conditions and generally not a good idea to use snow tires when it’s not snowing because it reduces gas mileage, therefore it is inefficient. Another design pattern is a model view controller design pattern in which a model represents an object, a view represent the visualization of the data of the model, and the controller controls the data flow into the model object and updates the view whenever the data changes. It responds to the requests of the system for information which is used in situations where websites . It is all around good pattern that can be used in an many situations similar to all terrain car tires.
