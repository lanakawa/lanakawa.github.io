Think of the convenience of having a specialized set of tires to solve the problems that come with the type of environment they’re being used in. Snow tires for snowy climates, off roading tires for dirt or sandy conditions, or standard tires for normal conditions. Now, imagine a specialized computer science pattern that can solve the common problems that occur in computer science. They’re not solutions that can just be copy and pasted into the problem to be solved, but a template that can be used to assists in the solving of the problem. There are specific design patterns that can be applied to specific problems that need to be solved. For example, some commonly used design patterns are, a singleton design pattern, a pattern whose only objective is to create one instance of a class and to provide a global access point to that object. Although the use isn’t very good unless used in a situation where it is absolutely needed, because the use of global variables is generally a bad practice because of its inefficiency.  This is similar to how snow tires are only really useful while driving though snowy conditions and generally not a good idea to use snow tires when it’s not snowing because it reduces gas mileage, therefore it is inefficient. Another design pattern is a model view controller design pattern in which a model represents an object, a view represent the visualization of the data of the model, and the controller controls the data flow into the model object and updates the view whenever the data changes. It responds to the requests of the system for information which good for many uses but works especially well in website design where MVCs are used for easy code maintenance to expand and grow.  Similar to how all terrain tires are good for all terrains but best for off roading. 

Personally, I don’t have my license therefore I don’t have much driving experience nor extensive knowledge of tires. I feel that this is similar to my experience with design patterns. The only experience I can recall where I used the MVC design pattern when I worked with the [bowfolio template]( https://github.com/bowfolios/bowfolios) in which MongoDB acted as the model, a templating system called Blaze acted as the view, and a routing mechanism called FlowRouter acted as the router. MongoDB was implemented by making our own collection to hold Mongo collections. The Blaze templating language just creates directory profile objects and FlowRouter just does things that a typical router does. I can’t make a tire analogy for this experience but I can relate my experience with using Mongo to the principles of design patterns, specifically the Model View Control design pattern.
