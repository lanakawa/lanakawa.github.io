When I decided that I wanted to learn programming, my main goal was to learn how to create my video game. As I learned more I decided that was too broad a goal and needed to create smaller and more concise goals I can work towards. Some skills I want to develop to reach this goal are my data structure and algorithm skills. I don't fully understand certain algorithm concepts and I have yet to learn about data structures, their properties, and when to use them. I also want to learn how to create helpful and efficient Unit tests to improve the programs I make.

In the future, I hope to have many experiences and meet new people that help me improve my skills. I have seen many events and competitions related to coding that I wanted to participate in, but I felt that I was not skilled enough to join. Hopefully I will reach a level where I am comfortable enough to join. I also hope to join clubs to network and meet others who can help me develop my skills and show me new ways to program. One club in particular I was interested in is the Association for Computing Machinery(ACM) at UH Manoa, which seems like the perfect place to get new experiences and make CS friends.
