## Java? JavaScript?
My coding journey only dates back to about a year ago when I declared my major in computer science, so I am still new to the topic of programming. I do not have a lot of experience with coding and have only used Java to code. With that said, JavaScript has some similarities with Java but many more differences. With what I have learned through JavaScript modules, JavaScript has similar syntaxes to Java, but its rules are laxer, with many shortcuts and shorthand. JavaScript doesn’t require you to make a class to create objects to run the program unlike Java. JavaScript also does not have static type checking so you are able to mismatch types without running into problems(sometimes) unlike Java.

## My training
To improve my understanding of JavaScript, I completed modules that taught the basics of JavaScript and ES6. In addition to this I worked on various timed problems that required me to write code that satisfied the given conditions. Although stressful, these exercises have helped me get used to the syntax of JavaScript and practice my coding skills. I didn’t complete the problems on my first time but as I redid them, I solved them faster until I had a time I was satisfied with. Continuing to work on these problems will definitely help me become fluent in JavaScript.
   
## Is it a good language...
I think JavaScript is a good programming language when using it as a tool for creating an interesting and interactive website. It is very easy to learn if you already have some knowledge of a C based language, but I do not think it is a good language to learn as a first language as it has syntax rules that do not translate to other languages very well. I also think JavaScript takes more work to create and maintain secure code due to the language not preventing errors due to its relaxed rules.
